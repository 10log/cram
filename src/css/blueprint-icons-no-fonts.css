/**
 * Custom BlueprintJS icons CSS replacement - Empty file
 *
 * This file replaces @blueprintjs/icons/lib/css/blueprint-icons.css
 * which only contains @font-face declarations for icon fonts.
 *
 * Since this app uses React's SVG icon rendering via the icon="name" prop,
 * the font-face declarations are not needed and cause browser warnings.
 *
 * All icon styling is provided by @blueprintjs/core/lib/css/blueprint.css
 * which is imported separately.
